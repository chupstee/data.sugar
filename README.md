# About data.sugar

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks made out of interest in Data Science.  
These research projects support [@data.sugar Instagram blog](https://www.instagram.com/data.sugar/) and [@data.sugar Telegram channel](https://t.me/data_sugar), which are scientific-popular blogs.

While the Instagram and Telegram blogs summarize the main findings and conclusions, the full researches are available here.

You can use the code posted here to verify the validity of the facts we discovered and published in the Insta blog and the Telegram channel.

## Projects

- [`Thirty Years Old`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chupstee/data.sugar/blob/master/00001_thirty_years_old/thirty_years_old.ipynb)  
    WHEN IS MY BRAIN UP?üéì  
    The human brain reaches its peak efficiency by the age of 30.  
    That say the scientists, we ask the data!  
    We wondered *if most of the artworks in the Moma database were actually created by artists in their 30s*.  
- [`The World Happiness Map`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chupstee/data.sugar/blob/master/00002_world_happiness/world_happiness.where.map.ipynb)  
    IN SEARCH OF üéàHAPPINESS: üåçWHERE?  
    Happiness is the most uncertain thing. People try to measure happiness like height or temperature.  
    For example, The World Happiness Report from Kaggle ranks 156 countries by their level of happiness on a 10-point scale.  
    Even in our search of happiness, we've also never been interested in anything but the data.  
    We would like to *discover the happiest places*!  
- [`The Relationship between Happiness and Health Indicators`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chupstee/data.sugar/blob/master/00002_world_happiness/world_happiness.what.health.ipynb)  
    IN SEARCH OF üéàHAPPINESS: üçîWHAT if HEALTH?  
    We continue our happiness challenge!  
    Today we would like to know how health makes us happy.  
    To compare health indicators with happiness score, we'll take the World Happiness Report from Kaggle, which ranks 156 countries for happiness on a 10-point scale, and use CIA data from The World Factbook.
- [`The Relationship between Happiness and Age of Population by Country`](https://github.com/chupstee/data.sugar/blob/master/00002_world_happiness/world_happiness.when.age.ipynb)
